# ML-Football-Prediction
Uses python3 modules bs4, urlopen, and csv

Web scrapes espn for team efficency stats as well as footballoutsider.com to gather S&P+ stats for each team. 
Teams schedules are also copied from espn and teams that have played eachother are pared together with the 
tag at the end being if the left team won (W) or lost (L). These statistics will then be used to train and 
test a machine learning model that is yet to be created.
